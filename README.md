# NodeSchool Vellore

Welcome to the NodeSchool Vellore chapter's repository. We use this repository for our website and almost all our communication.

Nodeschool Vellore is just getting started so please get in contact if you would like to help with setup or mentoring. GitHub Issues for this chapter will be used to keep track of all work that needs to be done from ideas, what needs to be done, what's being worked on and what has been resolved.
